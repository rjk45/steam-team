                <h1>Future goals</h1>
								<p>We all hold very strong interests in STEM. Some teammates like science, others math, some even engineering and technology. Our different interests and skills make us the perfect team. Together we decided that we want to compete in a lot of competitions to let other people know what an amazing and inclusive opportunity robotics club is. We also want to go deep into our interests. We all want to help young girls get a headstart and interest in STEM. In the future when life gets back to normal, we want to meet with other all girl teams, mentor and teach young girls, and share the idea of robotics. As a team we hope to qualify for further competitions and make memories as a school, a team, and most importantly, friends.</p>
								<h2>Ria</h2>
								<p>I started loving STEM from a young age with countless programs like scratch, block-ly, and the Hour of Code. I had loved seeing what would happen as a direct result of my coding. I started to explore and enjoy everything else that coding offered. As I grew older I learnt  html and discovered other front-end coding. This passion eventually led me to become the lead programmer and web-developer for our team, which I couldn’t enjoy more.</p>
								<h2>Riyashi</h2>
								<p>My curiosity initially ignited as a curious five-year-old with a Lego Friends set. As time went on, I started working my way up to the  more advanced structures using my Lego sets, until my parents gifted me a Build-Your-Own-Car set which I absolutely loved. I would spend hours working with the same set with the aim of making prototypes of cars powered by a motor, solar-panels, and even rubber-bands! Once I finally reached middle-school, I was extremely excited to join my school’s robotics team, where I could build robots and machines to my heart's content, which I could then use to compete with. Ever since I joined, a little more than a year ago, my strengths and passion in building led my team to make the decision to appoint me as the lead builder for the past two seasons.</p>
                <h2>Georgina</h2>
								<p>To be honest, there was no real “starting point” that triggered my love of writing. It could have stemmed from the fact that I am a huge bookworm, and I have been since what seems like forever. All I know is that writing is a way for me to be creative and express myself, and lets me release all of my creative energy that builds up in my head over time. It doesn’t matter what I’m working on- whether it is a school essay or a horror story, it just resonates with me. Due to all of these factors, I became the lead writer for Steam Team, taking the lead on two challenges and many more tasks. </p>
